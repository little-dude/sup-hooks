My [sup mail](https://sup.rubyforge.org/) hooks.
----------------------------------------

I have been setting up and liking sup (sup-mail in Ubuntu) quite a bit lately.
These are some of the hooks scripts I use.

There is a nice publish.rb hook that opens the formatted mail including inline images in chrome.
Just press P in the thread view.
I use firefox in a seperate workspace, so this way chrome becomes a pop-up window manager for sup pretty-format...
The idea is taken from the [sup-devel](http://www.mail-archive.com/sup-devel@rubyforge.org/msg01047.html) mailing list.
And it makes use of:  [mhonarc](http://www.mhonarc.org/) for the conversion.

Feel free to use
